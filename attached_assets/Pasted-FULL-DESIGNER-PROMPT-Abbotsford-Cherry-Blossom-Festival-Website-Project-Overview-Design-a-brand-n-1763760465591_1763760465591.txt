FULL DESIGNER PROMPT — Abbotsford Cherry Blossom Festival Website
Project Overview

Design a brand new website for the Abbotsford Cherry Blossom Festival — a spring community celebration inspired by the blossoms across Abbotsford.
The website should feel fresh, elegant, artistic, and nature-inspired, with clear emphasis on community culture, outdoor events, and blossom discovery.

The overall tone should match the style and structure of VCBF.ca, but customized to Abbotsford’s identity.
